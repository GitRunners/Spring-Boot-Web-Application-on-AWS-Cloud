For SSL Certificate, we followed the following steps:
1. We used AWS Certificate Manager Service, to create the certificate for our domain
2. Requested a new certificate for our domain and added an extra name to our domain *.domain-name
3. Then Asked for Domain Validation from AWS which got verified.
